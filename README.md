# Final Project for John Hopkins Data Science Specialization Module: Data Products

The assignment was to to create on online data product that takes user data as input and returns a prediction. 

My app is for advertisers and marketers. It predicts unit sales and return on investment (ROI) based on user input of:
* $ amount spent on TV advertising
* $ amount spent on Radio advertising
* $ Retail Price of the Product
* $ Cost of the product

The app runs a linear regreassion prediction model trained on the advertising data included in the book " Introduction to Statistical
Learning"

This is clearly a highly simplified model. 

To make real world predictions we'd need training data specific to the product and industry
we're trying to predict. 

But the emphasis here was less on making accurate predictions than on demonstrating the programing skills
needed to create the app.
